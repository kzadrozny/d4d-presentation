            <p>John: These Institute of Design students are designing tea
kettles. Check out the messy table, with different kinds of teapots or coffee
makers. They're going to look at different existing solutions for making tea,
see how they work, and try to come up with something new.</p>
            <p>Right now they're presenting research they did about how 
people prepare and drink tea, and how tea fits into their lives.</p> 
            <p>Including research into your decision making process is 
important. It's going to help keep your work grounded.  Although wild, fun
ideas are great for learning, in a real world situation you'll want to be sure
you're solving a problem that actually exists.</p>

            <p>John: Here, two students are talking through lots of different
ideas for their design. By having different materials around, like glass,
metal, or plastic, they can quickly experiement with the kinds of materials
that might get used in the final product. As a side note, one of my favorite
things about this picture is the chart on the wall in the background. It
contains a bunch of tea-related puns- including t-shirts, teepees and t-rex.
These might just be a tangent, or they might provide inspiration for the final
project. Because they're coming up with a lot of different ideas it's fine that
some of them are a little out there.</p>

            <p>By now the students have combined the work they did in their
research and in their idea generating sessions to narrow in on specific
directions for their work. Now the prototypes can start to get refined, 
and the students can feel confident that they're refining ideas that
solve real problems, because of their research, and that explore the
best possible solution, because they explored a range of possible solutions
before committing to one.</p>
            <p>Now that they have a prototype that looks more "real", they can
show it to potential users and get feedback on it. That feedback becomes the
input to another round of the process, where they can refine existing ideas or
come up with new ones.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Today we're going to be making a "fuzzy front end" prototype-
we'll be exploring the first part of this process.</p>
<p>The fuzzy front end is the part of the design process where we know we have
a problem to solve, but we haven't yet decided on a specific way to solve the
problem- we're still thinking through options. The solution might be a digital
interface, like a website or an app for a smart phone, tablet, or even a smart
watch. But it could also be some kind of physical object or in-person
service.</p>
            <p>To go through the entire prototyping process takes more time
than we have, and it takes people with traditional design skills to make
polished objects, interfaces, or documentation for services. Fortunately
though, the beginning of the process of designing something doesn't require as
much traditional design skill- so we can easily work with people who have other
skill sets and backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Although we'll be working fast, with only a little extra work
you could polish up the kinds of sketches you make today and show them to
patrons to see what they think, or you build off of the narrative you came up
with in your skit to talk through potential solutions in a little more
detail.</p>

          <h2>Grocery stores and healthy eating</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Kathy: Our sample problem is about helping grocery stores
encourage healthy eating.  We wanted to give you something to work on that
isn't directly related to libraries, so you'd have a chance to work on
something that isn't part of your day-to-day.</p>
            <p>Why this topic? Like libraries, grocery stores have an
information architecture. They use samples, endcaps and other displays to
introduce customers to things they didn’t necessarily come into the store for.
Grocery stores are pretty good at this.</p>
            <p>Libraries might often find themselves in a position where they'd
like patrons to use more of their services, or to use their services more
deeply.</p>
            <p>We hope that by spending a few hours prototyping grocery store
displays, apps and services that you will have new ideas about ways to
introduce library patrons to new services as well.</p>

            <p>Kathy: Here is the design process we'll be using. Now, today we
only have three and a half hours, so we'll have to move fast. But in the real
world, you would have more time to work. Not necessarily a lot more- recently
Google has been in the news for their five day design sprints, where teams make
a prototype in one week.  Having the chance to sleep on ideas is really
important, and unfortunately we don't have the time to do that here.</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about Google's design sprints, we'll
include information about them in links at the end of this slide deck.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>(Kathy hands the research out.)</p>
            <p>One of the first things we found is the Food Choice Research
Group at Cornell. We originally considered doing some user testing ourselves to 
give you a starting point. However, by spending a few hours looking at work that 
other people have done, we think we found some models here that are much better 
than what we would have come up with if we had spent a few weeks testing users 
ourselves. The lesson here is that in this case, spending a few hours looking 
for other people doing research like this was time well spent.</p>
            <p>Let's dig into some of their models now.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>First, they've got two different alternate scripts, that describe a
narrative for how different types of families choose what to eat for dinner, and
then how they go about preparing the meal and having it. There are other scripts
besides these two- the original research described eight different scripts- but
hopefully these are a helpful jumping off point.</p>

            <h1>The research continues: samples</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/oranges-on-sale.jpg"/>

					<aside class="notes">
                        <p>We also went into grocery stores to observe people
making food choices first hand.  At first our plan was to count the number of
people who stopped at different kinds of store samples, for example, for either
fruit or cheese, to see if we could learn something about how grocery store
samples work. When we started talking to the people who give out samples we
changed strategies though- we found that talking with just a few people gave us
some really nice insights into how free samples work in the grocery store.</p>
            <p>The lesson here is similar to what we learned before- asking
people who are really familiar with a subject is a great way to learn about it
quickly. And it was definitely faster than just counting the number of people
who walk by free fruit samples.</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
          <h1>Choose the right place.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/good-culture-cottage-cheese-cart.jpg"/><br/>
					  <q>Find high-traffic locations near the front of the store or along busy paths.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>We learned that it's important to choose the right place to 
introduce people to something new.</p>
            <p>Important displays are often located in the entryway of the 
store, or along the most common path people use to find their way around the 
store. For example, in my local Whole Foods, the entryway contains a sign
advertising the whole foods app, along with the weekly sale flyer and even
some displays for foods that are on sale. Just inside the door, in the produce
section, is a display with some really good but pretty expensive guacamole.</p>
            <p>Displays often incorporate a table- it creates a place along the
path to stop. Compare this to an endcap for a sale item that doesn't have a table.</p>
            <p>One woman used a shopping cart to create a mobile display- she
could walk up to people in line at the butcher counter and get them to try a
sample while they waited. While I watched she sold a lot of cottage cheese.</p>
            <p>One woman said, "don’t bother putting the granola display next
to the granola—or even the milk. Put it along a path in the store that gets a
lot of traffic."</p>
            <p>This is relevant in the world of libraries. When we've asked people
where they learn about new things at our library, they invariably say "signage 
that was placed right by the entry control station."</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          <h1>Choose the right time.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/granola-stand.jpg"/><br/>
					  <q>This granola display was very successful before a big football game- it seemed like people were looking for an alternative to traditional game day snacks.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>This is the woman with the granola stand advice from our last
slide. She also had good advice on timing- she gave out samples the weekend of a
big football game and managed to sell a lot of granola. People come into the 
grocery store looking to solve an immediate problem- they need food for something.
If you offer something that solves their problem, you have a better chance of 
convincing them to try something new that if it was totally random.</p>
            <p>Again, this relates to the world of libraries. During finals week,
we've put on a coloring event for people to relax and unwind- it was very well 
attended.</p>

				<section>
            <h1>Match customer needs.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/stonyfield-yogurt.jpg"/><br/>
					  <q>Live conversations let product reprentatives focus on a benefit like taste, health, or cost that might make sense to a specific shopper.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the reasons there are live people giving out samples is so that
they can figure out what you're looking for in a product, and then they can highlight 
those aspects of the product to you. Yogurt might be tasty, good for you, or on sale-
a live person can figure out which of those things you're looking for.</p>
            <p>Similarly, when it comes to signage and printed materials,
people see words they’re on the lookout for. If people are looking for things

            <p>(John passes out "prompt" cards.)</p>
            <p>Kathy: Because we're limited for time, we wanted to give you a
jumping off point to get started.</p>
            <p>There are two different kinds of prompts: "There's an app for
that" are app ideas, and "saucy services" are service design ideas.</p>
            <p>John: For the workshop, I'm defining service design as something
where you design the patron-facing and internal workflows that make something
happen. In the commercial world, one-click buying on Amazon.com is an example
of service design. As a customer what happens is simple, but there is
complexity on the back end that you're shielded from. A "Get it" button is an
example in libraries. From the patron's perspective, they just click a button
that gets the item they want from another library. But on the back end a lot
more happens.</p>
            <p>Kathy: We provided three different kinds of prompts, because at
the early-prototyping stage a lot of things can change. You might decide you
want to make an app, or a website, or you might nudge your idea a bit and make
it an in-person service. In-person services often have digital components to
them. Don't feel restricted to just one thing.</p>

buy more stuff at the store than usual.)</p>

            <p>Here are all the ideas I came up with. Based on the prompt, I came up
with ideas for in-store samples, apps or website features, and services. There were
lots of times when something could be either an app or a service- at the early stages
of generating ideas, it's really useful to be flexible.</p>
            <p>Try to push yourself to come up with a lot of ideas.</p>
            <p>One of the keys to this is that you're exploring ideas at a very
low resolution. If you decide you like an idea, you can "flesh it out" more later. But
for now, keep each individual idea simple so you can get a feeling for the range of 
potential solutions.</p>
            <p>These are "build to think" prototypes. For the students who were making
teapots that I showed you earlier, these are the equivalent of the early stages of the 
process. The point of this exercise is to help you think through the problem you're 
working on.</p>

						<p>The Miseducation of the Doodle, A List Apart, Sunni Brown<br/>
						<p>“Most of us have been socialized to believe that making things, whether sketches or models, is for creative people (not us), people with talent and hand skills (again, not us) and who understand the mysteries of color and proportion and form. This is a discouraging, art-based paradigm in which the value of the work is perceived to be in the output and it’s aesthetic properties. (new paragraph) There is a more productive and encouraging paradigm for making artifacts that focuses on discovery, rather than otucome. Let’s call it a learning- based paradigm, in which the value of building is the process of experimentation and the surfacing of meaning. ‘Build to think’ is a low-cost, high-impact method for helping teams find the conceptual center of their work.”</p>

						<p>Full Quote:<br/>
						“the simplest way to describe the design process is to divide it into two phases: analysis and synthesis. Or preparation and inspiration. But those descriptions miss a crucial element—the connection between the two, the active move from one state to another, the transition or transformation that is at the heart of designing. How do designers move from analysis to synthesis? From problem to solution? From current situation to preferred future? From research to concept? From constituent needs to proposed response? From context to form?</p>

						<p>Books about drawing<br/>
						(Learning how to draw well is worth the investment in time. Most people think it’s natural- it’s not. It’s weird to me that people accept that you will get better at playing the piano if you take lessons and practice, but they think that drawing is a thing you’re born with. Having taken drawing lessons, I have seen that my drawing skill goes up when I put in the time to practice. I recommend spending time on it if you want to really  do it.)</p>
						<p>Books about design methods and creativity<br/>
						(I am a big believer in “interchangable parts”. We combined several design methods in this workshop- internet research, quick interviews, an ideation session, prototyping and skits together to learn something. For information about other parts you can combine to design things with groups of people see the following books. The jones book especially is a good “background” book for some information on where design methods came from.)</p>
