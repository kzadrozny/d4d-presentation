            <p>You can prototype anything! Here's a prototype for a smart
phone app that works with a smart tv. This one looks like it's for a fantasy

            <p>This one is fancy. It's for a smart phone app. Even though this
was more work that the prototype for the tablet app, this is still much less
work than actually laying out the design and coding an app.</p>

            <p>One of the advantages of prototypes is that they let you experiment
with big changes quickly. To make a pixel-perfect design for one form factor,
and then adapt it to another, is a big project. Working on paper gives designers 
give the flexibility to experiment quickly and cheaply with big decisions.</p>

            <p>Here, two students are talking through different ideas for their design. By
having different materials around, like glass, metal, or plastic, it gets easier to think through
what types of materials might get used in the final product. As a side note, one of my favorite
things about this picture is the chart on the wall in the background. It contains a bunch of 
tea-related puns- including t-shirts, teepees and t-rex. These might just be a tangent, or they
might provide inspiration for the final project.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Today we're going to be making a "fuzzy front end" prototype. 
The fuzzy front end is the part of the design process where we know we have a
problem to solve, but we haven't yet decided on a specific way to solve the
problem- we're still thinking through options. The solution might be a digital
interface, like a website or an app for a smart phone, tablet, or even a smart
watch. But it could also be some kind of physical object or in-person
service.</p>

            <p>To go through the entire prototyping process takes more time
than we have, and it takes people with traditional design skills to make
polished objects, interfaces, or documentation for services. Fortunately
though, the beginning of the process of designing something doesn't require as
much traditional design skill- so we can easily work with people who have other
skill sets and backgrounds.</p>

            <p>By making quick drawings, we'll be able to explore a lot of
options fast.  You might feel self-conscious about your drawing skills, but
even if you do, try giving it a chance. With a little practice we hope you'll
find situations where drawing helps you communicate and think through ideas
better than you could by using words alone.</p>

          <h1>Our design process</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>Familiarize yourself with research.</li>
            <li>Quickly draw out different options.</li>
            <li>Rank the solutions you generated.</li>
            <li>Decide which to try.</li>
            <li>Make a short skit to demonstrate how your solution works.</li>
          </ol>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Here is the design process we'll be using. In the real world,
some things would be the same as what we'll be doing and some things would be
different.</p>

            <p>Regarding similarities- beginning with research, even if it's
just a bit, is always a good thing. It keeps idea-generating sessions grounded
in reality. Moving from research to prototyping different solutions is also
great because it helps you imagine the many different solutions a given problem
might have.</p>

            <p>One big difference is that in the real world you'd have more
time to work. Not necessarily a lot more- recently Google has been in the news
for their five day design sprints, where teams make a prototype in one week.
Having the chance to sleep on ideas is really important, and unfortunately we
don't have the time to do that here.</p>

            <p>A second thing we're missing is that we don't have time to get
feedback from users on the solutions we'll generate. That's really important,
because it adds to the research we start off with.</p>

            <p>Finally, we won't have time to iterate. By going through
something like the process we're doing today a few times, you can start to
polish and refine an idea, making it better each time.</p>

            <p>Having said that, we hope it's worthwhile to spend a few hours
getting a taste of what this is like. We find this process a lot of fun, and we
hope you'll enjoy it too- we tried to keep our sample materials silly and
playful. Although we have a lot to do, please try not to stress out as you
work. It's counter-productive.  For the sake of getting your feet wet, it's
definitely ok to have fun.</p>

          <h1>Grocery stores and healthy eating</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Our sample problem is about helping grocery stores encourage healthy eating. 
We wanted to give you something to work on that isn't directly related to libraries, so 
you'd have a chance to work on something that isn't part of your day-to-day.</p>
            <p>Why this topic? Like libraries, grocery stores have an information 
architecture. They use samples, endcaps and other displays to introduce customers to things 
they didn’t necessarily come into the store for. Grocery stores are pretty good at this.</p>
						<p>We hope that by spending a few hours prototyping grocery store displays you 
will have new ideas about ways to introduce library patrons to new services as well.</p>

            <p>Important displays (ex. store apps to promote sale items, or samples of high-margin products) will often be located along the path people use to enter the store.</p>
						<p>Many endcap displays are for products that are on sale. It’s surprising how thoroughly people ignore these. They even look away when they pass them.</p>
            <p>Displays often incorporate a table- it creates a place along the path to stop.</p>
            <p>One woman used a shopping cart to create a mobile display- she could walk up to people in line at the butcher counter and get them to try a sample while they waited. While I watched she sold a lot of cottage cheese.</p>

(My guess is that people are less likely to “step up to the counter” for a sample and then leave. Maybe these displays encourage customers who stepped up to the counter for one item to buy two?)</p>

            <p>[pass out three "prompt cards" for each table.]</p>
            <p>Because we're limited for time, we wanted to give you a jumping off point to get started. Especially
under time pressure, please feel free to come up with silly ideas. In the real world you would have more time to
polish the silly ideas and make them workable.</p>
            <p>There are three different kinds of prompts: "half-baked" ideas are a silly or unconventional starting
point. "There's an app for that" are app ideas, and "saucy services" are service design ideas.</p>
            <p>For the workshop, I'm defining service design as something where you design the patron-facing and 
internal workflows that make something happen. In the commercial world, one-click buying on Amazon.com is an 
example of service design. As a customer what happens is simple, but there is complexity on the back end that 
you're shielded from. A "Get it" button is an example in libraries. From the patron's perspective, they just click
a button that gets the item they want from another library. But on the back end a lot more happens.</p>
            <p>We provided three different kinds of prompts, because at the early-prototyping stage a lot of things
can change. You might decide you want to make an app, or a website, or you might nudge your idea a bit and make
it an in-person service. In-person services often have digital components to them. Don't feel restricted to just
one thing.</p>

            <p>Thinking about the insight from grocery store sample people about catching people at the right
time. One of the first things I do in the morning is check my smart phone. What if the grocery store tweeted
tips about healthy breakfast options for people who are just waking up?</p>

            <p>Because the prompt was about military stuff, I was thinking about World War II, and victory
gardens came to mind. Maybe the grocery store could give parking lot space to some boxed gardens- it would
make the parking lot attractive and the gardeners would be coming to the store all the time. (They'd probably
buy more stuff at the store than usual.)</p>

            <p>This was my "wild" idea. Why stop with a smart phone or smart watch app when the internet of
things is right around the corner? This is an app for your smart refrigerator- it yells at you when you 
snack too much, and it makes sure to always order more vegetables for home delivery.</p>

            <p>For this exercise, we'll be exploring ideas at a low level of
resolution. If you decide you like an idea, you can "flesh it out" more. But
for now, keep things simple.</p>
            <p>There are “build to decide” prototypes that are relatively
high-fidelity. Those are like the student's tea kettles from the end of their
class. But at the stage we're at we're making "build to think" prototypes.
Their purpose is to help us think about the problem we're working on.</p>

          <p>Why do this?</p>

					</ul>
            <p>pg. 43 from Communicating the New by Erwin: "build to think"
prototypes serve several important functions: the allow teams to experiment
with multiple ‘right’ answers at little cost or committment. they accelerate
learning, helping to surface opportunities and limitations early on. they take
the abstract and make it tangible and touchable, and there for open to review
by stakeholders both on the team and outside of it. they change the converation
around the table and create the all-important alignment teams need to proceed
in concert.”</p> 
            <p>“You learn things from building, maybe especially when building
before ideas are fully developed.” -marty thaler, pg. 42, Communicating the
New.</p>
            <p>Why drawing?</p>
						<ul>Drawing:
							<li>Improves focus.</li>
							<li>Improves retention and recall.</li>
							<li>Activates the “minds eye”, or the portions of the visual cortex that allow us to see mental imagery and manipulate concepts.</li>
							<li>Enhances access to the creative, problem-solving, and subconscious parts of the brain.</li>
							<li>Unifies three major learning motalities: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The Miseducation of the Doodle, A List Apart, Sunni Brown<br/>
						<p>“Most of us have been socialized to believe that making things, whether sketches or models, is for creative people (not us), people with talent and hand skills (again, not us) and who understand the mysteries of color and proportion and form. This is a discouraging, art-based paradigm in which the value of the work is perceived to be in the output and it’s aesthetic properties. (new paragraph) There is a more productive and encouraging paradigm for making artifacts that focuses on discovery, rather than otucome. Let’s call it a learning- based paradigm, in which the value of building is the process of experimentation and the surfacing of meaning. ‘Build to think’ is a low-cost, high-impact method for helping teams find the conceptual center of their work.”</p>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>This exercise is a form of brainstorming. Sometimes you might
hear things about how brainstorming is an ineffective design method. A lot of
those criticisms have valid qualities, and it's great to always be looking for
better and better ways to do things. At the same time, coming up with a large
pile of options to choose from is still a foundational method. So many other 
methods assume this step that it's worth getting practice.</p>
						<p>Aim for 20 options. Try to make a quick drawing for each one, 
if you can.</p>

          <h2>Sorting ideas by effort and reward</h2>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/effort-reward-2-by-2.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
            <p>I found a video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grj-UKUAVM where one of the authors of the book Gamestorming switched the 2x2 around a bit- he put high reward, low effort in the upper right hand corner. I think that lends itself to situations where you know you will find easy, high-impact ideas. However, sorting it the way I do provides room for the kind of "difficult, but important to the mission" activities that non-profits often take on.</p>

            <p>This model has a close relative- the Eisenhower model, popularized by Steven Covey. It plots out tasks by their urgency and their importance.</p>

						<p>Full Quote:<br/>
						“the simplest way to describe the design process is to divide it into two phases: analysis and synthesis. Or preparation and inspiration. But those descriptions miss a crucial element—the connection between the two, the active move from one state to another, the transition or transformation that is at the heart of designing. How do designers move from analysis to synthesis? From problem to solution? From current situation to preferred future? From research to concept? From constituent needs to proposed response? From context to form?</p>

						<p>Books about drawing<br/>
						(Learning how to draw well is worth the investment in time. Most people think it’s natural- it’s not. It’s weird to me that people accept that you will get better at playing the piano if you take lessons and practice, but they think that drawing is a thing you’re born with. Having taken drawing lessons, I have seen that my drawing skill goes up when I put in the time to practice. I recommend spending time on it if you want to really  do it.)</p>
						<p>Books about design methods and creativity<br/>
						(I am a big believer in “interchangable parts”. We combined several design methods in this workshop- internet research, quick interviews, an ideation session, prototyping and skits together to learn something. For information about other parts you can combine to design things with groups of people see the following books. The jones book especially is a good “background” book for some information on where design methods came from.)</p>
