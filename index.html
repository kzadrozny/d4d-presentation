              <p>Today we're going to give you the chance to practice
prototyping in two different ways- we call those "prototype-to-think" and
"prototype-to-communicate". First we'll be making quick sketches to think
through different ways to respond to a design problem, and second we'll be
making short three-act skits to help you tell the group about why your 
solution is necessary and how it solves a problem.</p>
              <p>Finally, we'll wrap up with some resources you mind find
helpful if you like doing this and want to go further.</p>

            <p>You can prototype anything! Here's a prototype for a smart
phone app that works with a smart tv. This one looks like it's for a fantasy
sports team.</p>

            <p>This one is fancy. It's for a smart phone app. Even though this
was more work that the prototype for the tablet app, this is still much less
work than actually laying out the design and coding an app.</p>

            <p>One of the advantages of prototypes is that they let you experiment
with big changes quickly. To make a pixel-perfect design for one form factor,
and then adapt it to another, is a big project. Working on paper gives designers 
give the flexibility to experiment quickly and cheaply with big decisions.</p>

            <p>You can prototype physical objects too. Here are some prototypes for a cell

might feel when you hold them.</p>

            <p>Here, two students are talking through different ideas for their design. By
having different materials around, like glass, metal, or plastic, it gets easier to think through
what types of materials might get used in the final product. As a side note, one of my favorite
things about this picture is the chart on the wall in the background. It contains a bunch of 
tea-related puns- including t-shirts, teepees and t-rex. These might just be a tangent, or they
might provide inspiration for the final project.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Today we're going to be making a "fuzzy front end" prototype. 
The fuzzy front end is the part of the design process where we know we have a
problem to solve, but we haven't yet decided on a specific way to solve the
problem- we're still thinking through options. The solution might be a digital
interface, like a website or an app for a smart phone, tablet, or even a smart
watch. But it could also be some kind of physical object or in-person
service.</p>

            <p>To go through the entire prototyping process takes more time
than we have, and it takes people with traditional design skills to make
polished objects, interfaces, or documentation for services. Fortunately
though, the beginning of the process of designing something doesn't require as
much traditional design skill- so we can easily work with people who have other
skill sets and backgrounds.</p>

            <p>By making quick drawings, we'll be able to explore a lot of
options fast.  You might feel self-conscious about your drawing skills, but
even if you do, try giving it a chance. With a little practice we hope you'll
find situations where drawing helps you communicate and think through ideas
better than you could by using words alone.</p>

          <h1>Why user testing?</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The name of our session is "from user testing to prototypes:
making observations tangible." Why incorporate user testing? We think there
are a few good reasons. For one, it's going to help keep your work grounded.
Although wild, fun ideas are great for learning, in a real world situation
you'll want to be sure you're solving a problem that actually exists.</p>
            <p>Second: although we won't have time to do it today, in 
a real situation, once you have a prototype you can get feedback on it. With
only a little bit of extra work you can polish up quick sketches and show 
them to patrons to see what they think, or you can use the narrative you 
came up with in your skit to talk through potential solutions in a little 
more detail. That feedback becomes the input for another round of coming
up with new ideas or refinements.</p>
            <p>Rather than doing a workshop about prototyping in isolation,
we wanted to combine the two things.</p>

            <li>Quickly draw out different potential solutions.</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Here is the design process we'll be using. Now, today we only
have three and a half hours, so we'll have to move fast. But in the real world,
you would have more time to work. Not necessarily a lot more- recently Google
has been in the news for their five day design sprints, where teams make a
prototype in one week.  Having the chance to sleep on ideas is really
important, and unfortunately we don't have the time to do that here.</p>
            <p>If you want to learn more about Google's design sprints, we'll
include information about them in links at the end of this slide deck.</p>

          <h1>Grocery stores and healthy eating</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Our sample problem is about helping grocery stores encourage healthy eating. 
We wanted to give you something to work on that isn't directly related to libraries, so 
you'd have a chance to work on something that isn't part of your day-to-day.</p>
            <p>Why this topic? Like libraries, grocery stores have an information 
architecture. They use samples, endcaps and other displays to introduce customers to things 
they didn’t necessarily come into the store for. Grocery stores are pretty good at this.</p>
            <p>Libraries might often find themselves in a position where they'd like patrons
to use more of their services, or to use their services more deeply.</p>
						<p>We hope that by spending a few hours prototyping grocery store displays you 
will have new ideas about ways to introduce library patrons to new services as well.</p>

            <img class="stretch" src="img/cornell-food-choice-group-homepage.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the first things we found is the Food Choice Research
Group at Cornell. We originally considered doing some user testing ourselves to 
give you a starting point. However, by spending a few hours looking at work that 
other people have done, we think we found some models here that are much better 
than what we would have come up with if we had spent a few weeks testing users 
ourselves. The lesson here is that in this case, spending a few hours looking 
for other people doing research like this was time well spent.</p>
            <p>Let's dig into some of their models now.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>First, they've got two different alternate scripts, that describe a
narrative for how different types of families choose what to eat for dinner, and
then how they go about preparing the meal and having it. There are other scripts
besides these two- the original research described eight different scripts- but
hopefully these are a helpful jumping off point.</p>

            <h1>The research continues: samples</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/oranges-on-sale.jpg"/>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We also went into grocery stores to observe people using samples and endcaps. 
At first our plan was to count the number of people who stopped at different kinds of store samples,
for example, for either fruit or cheese, to see if we could learn something about how grocery store
samples work. When we started talking to the people who give out samples we changed strategies though-
we found that talking with just a few people gave us some really nice insights into how free samples
work in the grocery store.</p>
            <p>The lesson here is similar to what we learned before- asking people who are really 
familiar with a subject is a great way to learn about it quickly. And it was definitely faster than
just counting the number of people who walk by free fruit samples.</p>

            <img class="stretch" src="img/good-culture-cottage-cheese-cart.jpg"/><br/>
					  <q>Find high-traffic locations near the front of the store or along busy paths.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>Important displays are often located in the entryway of the 
store, or along the most common path people use to find their way around the 
store. For example, in my local Whole Foods, the entryway contains a sign
advertising the whole foods app, along with the weekly sale flyer and even
some displays for foods that are on sale. Just inside the door, in the produce
section, is a display with some really good but pretty expensive guacamole.</p>
            <p>Displays often incorporate a table- it creates a place along the
path to stop. Compare this to an endcap for a sale item that doesn't have a table.</p>
            <p>One woman used a shopping cart to create a mobile display- she
could walk up to people in line at the butcher counter and get them to try a
sample while they waited. While I watched she sold a lot of cottage cheese.</p>
            <p>One woman said, "don’t bother putting the granola display next
to the granola—or even the milk. Put it along a path in the store that gets a
lot of traffic."</p>

          <h1>Choose the right time.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/granola-stand.jpg"/><br/>
					  <q>This granola display was very successful before a big football game- it seemed like people were looking for an alternative to traditional game day snacks.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>This is the woman with the granola stand advice from our last
slide. She also had good advice on timing- she gave out samples the weekend of a
big football game and managed to sell a lot of granola. People come into the 
grocery store looking to solve an immediate problem- they need food for something.
If you offer something that solves their problem, you have a better chance of 
convincing them to try something new that if it was totally random.</p>

					  <q>Live conversations let product reprentatives focus on a benefit like taste, health, or cost that might make sense to a specific shopper.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the reasons there are live people giving out samples is so that
they can figure out what you're looking for in a product, and then they can highlight 
those aspects of the product to you. Yogurt might be tasty, good for you, or on sale-
a live person can figure out which of those things you're looking for.</p>
            <p>Similarly, when it comes to signage and printed materials,
people see words they’re on the lookout for. If people are looking for things
without gluten, they’ll see the word "gluten" on the package. Other people
won’t know the word is there.</p>
            <p>We observed this in libraries looking at the kinds of library news 
stories people click on. When people know a little bit about a topic, they were 
more likely to click to learn more.</p>

            <p>One thing that most people giving out samples told us was that
many people need to be asked "would you like to try one?" before they would try.</p>
            <p>Many displays create opportunities for employees (of the store

            <p>[pass out three "prompt cards" for each table.]</p>
            <p>Because we're limited for time, we wanted to give you a jumping off point to get started. Especially
under time pressure, please feel free to come up with silly ideas. In the real world you would have more time to
polish the silly ideas and make them workable.</p>
            <p>There are three different kinds of prompts: "half-baked" ideas are a silly or unconventional starting
point. "There's an app for that" are app ideas, and "saucy services" are service design ideas.</p>
            <p>For the workshop, I'm defining service design as something where you design the patron-facing and 
internal workflows that make something happen. In the commercial world, one-click buying on Amazon.com is an 
example of service design. As a customer what happens is simple, but there is complexity on the back end that 
you're shielded from. A "Get it" button is an example in libraries. From the patron's perspective, they just click
a button that gets the item they want from another library. But on the back end a lot more happens.</p>
            <p>We provided three different kinds of prompts, because at the early-prototyping stage a lot of things
can change. You might decide you want to make an app, or a website, or you might nudge your idea a bit and make
it an in-person service. In-person services often have digital components to them. Don't feel restricted to just
one thing.</p>

buy more stuff at the store than usual.)</p>

            <p>Here are all the ideas I came up with. Try to push yourself 
to come up with a lot of ideas.</p>
            <p>One of the keys to this is that you're exploring ideas at a very
low resolution. If you decide you like an idea, you can "flesh it out" more later. But
for now, keep each individual idea simple so you can get a feeling for the range of 
potential solutions.</p>
            <p>These are "build to think" prototypes. For the students who were making
teapots that I showed you earlier, these are the equivalent of the early stages of the

            <p>pg. 43 from Communicating the New by Erwin: "build to think"
prototypes serve several important functions: the allow teams to experiment
with multiple ‘right’ answers at little cost or committment. they accelerate
learning, helping to surface opportunities and limitations early on. they take
the abstract and make it tangible and touchable, and there for open to review
by stakeholders both on the team and outside of it. they change the converation
around the table and create the all-important alignment teams need to proceed
in concert.”</p> 
            <p>“You learn things from building, maybe especially when building
before ideas are fully developed.” -marty thaler, pg. 42, Communicating the
New.</p>
            <p>Why drawing?</p>
						<ul>Drawing:
							<li>Improves focus.</li>
							<li>Improves retention and recall.</li>
							<li>Activates the “minds eye”, or the portions of the visual cortex that allow us to see mental imagery and manipulate concepts.</li>
							<li>Enhances access to the creative, problem-solving, and subconscious parts of the brain.</li>
							<li>Unifies three major learning motalities: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic.</li>

						<p>The Miseducation of the Doodle, A List Apart, Sunni Brown<br/>
						<p>“Most of us have been socialized to believe that making things, whether sketches or models, is for creative people (not us), people with talent and hand skills (again, not us) and who understand the mysteries of color and proportion and form. This is a discouraging, art-based paradigm in which the value of the work is perceived to be in the output and it’s aesthetic properties. (new paragraph) There is a more productive and encouraging paradigm for making artifacts that focuses on discovery, rather than otucome. Let’s call it a learning- based paradigm, in which the value of building is the process of experimentation and the surfacing of meaning. ‘Build to think’ is a low-cost, high-impact method for helping teams find the conceptual center of their work.”</p>

arranging your ideas in two dimensions. You can pick different axes, but here we're
choosing effort and reward. Take four post it notes: write "low effort", "high effort",
"low reward", "high reward", and arrange them on your tables like this.</p>

						<p>Full Quote:<br/>
						“the simplest way to describe the design process is to divide it into two phases: analysis and synthesis. Or preparation and inspiration. But those descriptions miss a crucial element—the connection between the two, the active move from one state to another, the transition or transformation that is at the heart of designing. How do designers move from analysis to synthesis? From problem to solution? From current situation to preferred future? From research to concept? From constituent needs to proposed response? From context to form?</p>

						<p>Books about drawing<br/>
						(Learning how to draw well is worth the investment in time. Most people think it’s natural- it’s not. It’s weird to me that people accept that you will get better at playing the piano if you take lessons and practice, but they think that drawing is a thing you’re born with. Having taken drawing lessons, I have seen that my drawing skill goes up when I put in the time to practice. I recommend spending time on it if you want to really  do it.)</p>
						<p>Books about design methods and creativity<br/>
						(I am a big believer in “interchangable parts”. We combined several design methods in this workshop- internet research, quick interviews, an ideation session, prototyping and skits together to learn something. For information about other parts you can combine to design things with groups of people see the following books. The jones book especially is a good “background” book for some information on where design methods came from.)</p>
