					<h1>How might we...</h1>
					<h2>encourage people to install and use a grocery store app that encourages healthy food choices?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Why this topic? Like libraries, grocery stores have an information architecture. They use samples, endcaps and other displays to introduce customers to things they didn’t necessarily come into the store for.</p>
						<p>We hope that by spending a few hours prototyping grocery store displays you will have new ideas about ways to introduce library patrons to new services as well.</p>

            <p>Important displays (ex. store apps to promote sale items, or samples of high-margin products) will often be located along the path people use to enter the store.</p>
						<p>Many endcap displays are for products that are on sale. It’s surprising how thoroughly people ignore these. They even look away when they pass them.</p>
            <p>Displays often incorporate a table- it creates a place along the path to stop.</p>
            <p>One woman used a shopping cart to create a mobile display- she could walk up to people in line at the butcher counter and get them to try a sample while they waited. While I watched she sold a lot of cottage cheese.</p>
					  <p>One woman said, "don’t bother putting the granola display next to the granola—or even the milk. Put it along a path in the store that gets a lot of traffic."</p>

						<p>A woman used a shopping cart as a “movable display”- she was promoting cottage cheese. Wherever she stopped, the cart acted as a table for people to gather around.</p>
						<p>Questions: How do sample tables, with a product representative, perform? Do people watch demonstrations? How do they perform? How do samples at the meat counter or deli counter perform? (My guess is that people are less likely to “step up to the counter” for a sample and then leave. Maybe these displays encourage customers who stepped up to the counter for one item to buy two?)</p>

						<p>pg. 43: “build to think prototypes serve several important functions: the allow teams to experiment with multiple ‘right’ answers at little cost or committment. they accelerate learning, helping to surface opportunities and limitations early on. they take the abstract and make it tangible and touchable, and there for open to review by stakeholders both on the team and outside of it. they change the converation around the table and create the all-important alignment teams need to proceed in concert.”</p>

						http://alistapart.com/article/the-miseducation-of-the-doodle</p>
						<p>“Most of us have been socialized to believe that making things, whether sketches or models, is for creative people (not us), people with talent and hand skills (again, not us) and who understand the mysteries of color and proportion and form. This is a discouraging, art-based paradigm in which the value of the work is perceived to be in the output and it’s aesthetic properties. (new paragraph) There is a more productive and encouraging paradigm for making artifacts that focuses on discovery, rather than otucome. Let’s call it a learning- based paradigm, in which the value of building is the process of experimentation and the surfacing of meaning. ‘Build to think’ is a low-cost, high-impact method for helping teams find the conceptual center of their work.”</p>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>I found a video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_grj-UKUAVM where one of the authors of the book Gamestorming switched the 2x2 around a bit- he put high reward, low effort in the upper right hand corner. I think that lends itself to situations where you know you will find easy, high-impact ideas. However, sorting it the way I do provides room for the kind of "difficult, but important to the mission" activities that non-profits often take on.</p>

            <p>This model has a close relative- the Eisenhower model, popularized by Steven Covey. It plots out tasks by their urgency and their importance.</p>

						<p>Props:<br/>
						Use sharpies and paper to make a display. Get someone, or some people, in your group to act out how eating healthier might fit into their lives and how the display might help.</p>
						<p>Three-act Skits:<br/>
						Scene one introduces the problem. Scene two shows how customers might interact with the grocery store display, and scene three shows the positive effect of the healthy food.</p>
						<p>Be concise:<br/>
						If you’ve come up with a lot of ideas so far, try to be concise now. Do your best to communicate one aspect of the solution well- whether it’s the problem that gets solved, or a novel way the grocery store display works.</p>

						<p>Full Quote:<br>
						“the simplest way to describe the design process is to divide it into two phases: analysis and synthesis. Or preparation and inspiration. But those descriptions miss a crucial element—the connection between the two, the active move from one state to another, the transition or transformation that is at the heart of designing. How do designers move from analysis to synthesis? From problem to solution? From current situation to preferred future? From research to concept? From constituent needs to proposed response? From context to form?</p>

						<p>Books about drawing<br/>
						(Learning how to draw well is worth the investment in time. Most people think it’s natural- it’s not. It’s weird to me that people accept that you will get better at playing the piano if you take lessons and practice, but they think that drawing is a thing you’re born with. Having taken drawing lessons, I have seen that my drawing skill goes up when I put in the time to practice. I recommend spending time on it if you want to really  do it.)</p>
						<p>Books about design methods and creativity<br/>
						(I am a big believer in “interchangable parts”. We combined several design methods in this workshop- internet research, quick interviews, an ideation session, prototyping and skits together to learn something. For information about other parts you can combine to design things with groups of people see the following books. The jones book especially is a good “background” book for some information on where design methods came from.)</p>
