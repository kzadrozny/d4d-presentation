            <p>John: These Institute of Design students are designing tea
kettles. Check out the messy table, with different kinds of teapots or coffee
makers. They're going to look at different existing solutions for making tea,
see how they work, and try to come up with something new.</p>
            <p>Right now they're presenting research they did about how 
people prepare and drink tea, and how tea fits into their lives.</p> 
            <p>Including research into your decision making process is 
important. It's going to help keep your work grounded.  Although wild, fun
ideas are great for learning, in a real world situation you'll want to be sure
you're solving a problem that actually exists.</p>

            <p>John: Here, two students are talking through lots of different
ideas for their design. By having different materials around, like glass,
metal, or plastic, they can quickly experiement with the kinds of materials
that might get used in the final product. As a side note, one of my favorite
things about this picture is the chart on the wall in the background. It
contains a bunch of tea-related puns- including t-shirts, teepees and t-rex.
These might just be a tangent, or they might provide inspiration for the final
project. Because they're coming up with a lot of different ideas it's fine that
some of them are a little out there.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>By now the students have combined the work they did in their
research and in their idea generating sessions to narrow in on specific
directions for their work. Now the prototypes can start to get refined, 
and the students can feel confident that they're refining ideas that
solve real problems, because of their research, and that explore the
best possible solution, because they explored a range of possible solutions
before committing to one.</p>
            <p>Now that they have a prototype that looks more "real", they can
show it to potential users and get feedback on it. That feedback becomes the
input to another round of the process, where they can refine existing ideas or
come up with new ones.</p>
            <p>One of the things I like about this is that the teapot in the 
front looks a bit like a teepee. I'm not sure if that's a happpy accident or
if it was on purpose.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Today we're going to be making a "fuzzy front end" prototype-
we'll be exploring the first part of this process.</p>
<p>The fuzzy front end is the part of the design process where we know we have
a problem to solve, but we haven't yet decided on a specific way to solve the
problem- we're still thinking through options. The solution might be a digital
interface, like a website or an app for a smart phone, tablet, or even a smart
watch. But it could also be some kind of physical object or in-person
service.</p>
            <p>To go through the entire prototyping process takes more time
than we have, and it takes people with traditional design skills to make
polished objects, interfaces, or documentation for services. Fortunately
though, the beginning of the process of designing something doesn't require as
much traditional design skill- so we can easily work with people who have other
skill sets and backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Although we'll be working fast, with only a little extra work
you could polish up the kinds of sketches you make today and show them to
patrons to see what they think, or you build off of the narrative you came up
with in your skit to talk through potential solutions in a little more
detail.</p>

          <h1>Choose the right place.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/good-culture-cottage-cheese-cart.jpg"/><br/>
            <q>Find high-traffic locations near the front of the store or along busy paths.</q>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We learned that it's important to choose the right place to 
introduce people to something new.</p>
            <p>Important displays are often located in the entryway of the 
store, or along the most common path people use to find their way around the 
store. For example, in my local Whole Foods, the entryway contains a sign
advertising the whole foods app, along with the weekly sale flyer and even
some displays for foods that are on sale. Just inside the door, in the produce
section, is a display with some really good but pretty expensive guacamole.</p>
            <p>Displays often incorporate a table- it creates a place along the
path to stop. Compare this to an endcap for a sale item that doesn't have a table.</p>
            <p>One woman used a shopping cart to create a mobile display- she
could walk up to people in line at the butcher counter and get them to try a
sample while they waited. While I watched she sold a lot of cottage cheese.</p>
            <p>One woman said, "don’t bother putting the granola display next
to the granola—or even the milk. Put it along a path in the store that gets a
lot of traffic."</p>
            <p>This is relevant in the world of libraries. When we've asked people
where they learn about new things at our library, they invariably say "signage 
that was placed right by the entry control station."</p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-background="#c4c5bc">
          <h1>Choose the right time.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/granola-stand.jpg"/><br/>
            <q>This granola display was very successful before a big football game- it seemed like people were looking for an alternative to traditional game day snacks.</q>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is the woman with the granola stand advice from our last
slide. She also had good advice on timing- she gave out samples the weekend of a
big football game and managed to sell a lot of granola. People come into the 
grocery store looking to solve an immediate problem- they need food for something.
If you offer something that solves their problem, you have a better chance of 
convincing them to try something new that if it was totally random.</p>
            <p>Again, this relates to the world of libraries. During finals week,
we've put on a coloring event for people to relax and unwind- it was very well 
attended.</p>

            <h1>Match customer needs.</h1>
            <img class="stretch" src="img/stonyfield-yogurt.jpg"/><br/>
            <q>Live conversations let product reprentatives focus on a benefit like taste, health, or cost that might make sense to a specific shopper.</q>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the reasons there are live people giving out samples is so that
they can figure out what you're looking for in a product, and then they can highlight 
those aspects of the product to you. Yogurt might be tasty, good for you, or on sale-
a live person can figure out which of those things you're looking for.</p>
            <p>Similarly, when it comes to signage and printed materials,
people see words they’re on the lookout for. If people are looking for things
without gluten, they’ll see the word "gluten" on the package. Other people
won’t know the word is there.</p>
            <p>We observed this in libraries looking at the kinds of library news 
stories people click on. When people know a little bit about a topic, they were 
more likely to click to learn more.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One thing that most people giving out samples told us was that
many people need to be asked "would you like to try one?" before they would try.</p>

            <p>Kathy: [Read Letter]</p>
            <p>Why have we hired librarians as staff? Like libraries, grocery stores have an
information architecture. They use samples, endcaps and other displays to
introduce customers to things they didn’t necessarily come into the store for.
Grocery stores are pretty good at this.</p>
            <p>Libraries might often find themselves in a position where they'd
like patrons to use more of their services, or to use their services more
deeply.</p>
            <p>We hope that by spending a few hours prototyping grocery store
displays, apps and services that you will have new ideas about ways to
introduce library patrons to new services as well.</p>

            <p>Ok, now taking a transformation card- I should try to make the idea about 
cost, saving money. Thinking about military stuff reminds me of WWII victory gardens...
Maybe the grocery store could give parking lot space to some boxed gardens- it would
make the parking lot attractive and the gardeners would be coming to the store all the time. 
(Maybe they'd buy more stuff than usual, actually.)</p>
            <p>It's important that there isn't too much detail in these drawings, actually.

            <p>Here are all the ideas I came up with. there are ideas for
in-store samples, apps or website features, and services.</p>
            <p>Try to push yourself to come up with a lot of ideas.</p>
            <p>One of the keys to this is that you're exploring ideas at a very
low resolution. If you decide you like an idea, you can "flesh it out" more later. But
for now, keep each individual idea simple so you can get a feeling for the range of 
potential solutions.</p>
            <p>These are "build to think" prototypes. For the students who were making
teapots that I showed you earlier, these are the equivalent of the early stages of the 
process. The point of this exercise is to help you think through the problem you're 
working on.</p>
          <p>Feel free to use the prompt cards or the transforming idea cards however
you'd like. If they help, great. if it's easier to come up with ideas without them, 
that's fine too.</p>

              <p>Libraries don't tend to generate physical things- instead they
make digital things and new services. Storyboards and skits are prototyping methods you
can use for the kinds of services that libraries offer.</p>

              <p>This image is from the BarnRaise 2015 design conference in Chicago.
This design team was assigned the task of helping a company called Janus Choice figure 
out how to communicate about its product.</p>

              <p>Janus Choice makes an app that helps hospital patients choose
a long-term care facility after they have received their discharge orders from the
hospital.</p> 

              <p>Some things to note- all props were build quickly using paper and
markers- the nurses costume, the patient's cast, and the app mockup were all drawn
using oversized post-it pads.</p>

              <p>Because you'll be telling a story, the process of making a
skit will help you find a conceptual center for your team's idea and expand on
it. For the Janus Choice skit, the team focused on how the app could reduce the
complexity of this descision process for a patient and their family. The
narrative they developed could be polished and used to communicate about Janus
Choice with patients or potential investors.</p>

            <p>Generally, for skits, I'll just sit down and write them out.
Sometimes I'll do this on the train on the way to work- note all the 
scribbles as I'm thinking through things. I find that if I'm writing words for
people to say "on stage" that it's easy to spot where I'm getting into too much
detail that isn't important at this stage.</p>

it with Kathy, we can make some more changes then. We've come up with narratives

            <p>This image shows different interface pieces the designer could
use to mock up different screens on the app. As potential users "click" by pressing
their finger down on the paper, the designer can scroll by moving the paper, or 
change the state of buttons or other widgets by placing the little extra pieces
of paper where they'd need to go. This lets him get a sense of what the real 
interface might need.</p>

            <p>Here's the home screen of our prototype- we ended up making a
scavenger hunt game.</p>
            <p>We learned a lot by doing this project. I think the most important thing is 
how hard it actually is to get people to use an app in the first place. Learning about an app,
downloading it, and actually using it are a lot of hurdles to get past. For the Park District
project, prototyping like this got us to a point where we were spending as much time on the 
signage that told people about the app as we were on the app itself.</p>
<p>That experience led into this workshop. We wanted to make a workshop that is
about prototypes that explore the context around an app or service, because the
context around the thing you make is incredibly important. You have to be fully
aware of how big of a deal it is to try to get someone like a visitor to the
Chicago Park District to put a new piece of software on their phone and run
it.</p>
