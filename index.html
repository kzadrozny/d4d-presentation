            <p>John: These Institute of Design students are designing tea
kettles. Check out the messy table, with different kinds of teapots or coffee
makers. They're going to look at different existing solutions for making tea,
see how they work, and try to come up with something new.</p>
            <p>Right now they're presenting research they did about how 
people prepare and drink tea, and how tea fits into their lives.</p> 
            <p>Including research into your decision making process is 
important. It's going to help keep your work grounded.  Although wild, fun
ideas are great for learning, in a real world situation you'll want to be sure
you're solving a problem that actually exists.</p>

            <p>John: Here, two students are talking through lots of different
ideas for their design. By having different materials around, like glass,
metal, or plastic, they can quickly experiement with the kinds of materials
that might get used in the final product. As a side note, one of my favorite
things about this picture is the chart on the wall in the background. It
contains a bunch of tea-related puns- including t-shirts, teepees and t-rex.
These might just be a tangent, or they might provide inspiration for the final
project. Because they're coming up with a lot of different ideas it's fine that
some of them are a little out there.</p>

            <p>By now the students have combined the work they did in their
research and in their idea generating sessions to narrow in on specific
directions for their work. Now the prototypes can start to get refined, 
and the students can feel confident that they're refining ideas that
solve real problems, because of their research, and that explore the
best possible solution, because they explored a range of possible solutions
before committing to one.</p>
            <p>Now that they have a prototype that looks more "real", they can
show it to potential users and get feedback on it. That feedback becomes the
input to another round of the process, where they can refine existing ideas or
come up with new ones.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Today we're going to be making a "fuzzy front end" prototype-
we'll be exploring the first part of this process.</p>
<p>The fuzzy front end is the part of the design process where we know we have
a problem to solve, but we haven't yet decided on a specific way to solve the
problem- we're still thinking through options. The solution might be a digital
interface, like a website or an app for a smart phone, tablet, or even a smart
watch. But it could also be some kind of physical object or in-person
service.</p>
            <p>To go through the entire prototyping process takes more time
than we have, and it takes people with traditional design skills to make
polished objects, interfaces, or documentation for services. Fortunately
though, the beginning of the process of designing something doesn't require as
much traditional design skill- so we can easily work with people who have other
skill sets and backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Although we'll be working fast, with only a little extra work
you could polish up the kinds of sketches you make today and show them to
patrons to see what they think, or you build off of the narrative you came up
with in your skit to talk through potential solutions in a little more
detail.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Kathy: Our sample problem is about helping grocery stores
encourage healthy eating.  We wanted to give you something to work on that
isn't directly related to libraries, so you'd have a chance to work on
something that isn't part of your day-to-day.</p>
            <p>Why this topic? Like libraries, grocery stores have an
information architecture. They use samples, endcaps and other displays to
introduce customers to things they didn’t necessarily come into the store for.
Grocery stores are pretty good at this.</p>
            <p>Libraries might often find themselves in a position where they'd
like patrons to use more of their services, or to use their services more
deeply.</p>
            <p>We hope that by spending a few hours prototyping grocery store
displays, apps and services that you will have new ideas about ways to
introduce library patrons to new services as well.</p>

            <p>(Kathy hands the research out.)</p>
            <p>One of the first things we found is the Food Choice Research
Group at Cornell. We originally considered doing some user testing ourselves to 
give you a starting point. However, by spending a few hours looking at work that 
other people have done, we think we found some models here that are much better 
than what we would have come up with if we had spent a few weeks testing users 
ourselves. The lesson here is that in this case, spending a few hours looking 
for other people doing research like this was time well spent.</p>

            <p>First, they've got two different alternate scripts, that describe a
narrative for how different types of families choose what to eat for dinner, and
then how they go about preparing the meal and having it. There are other scripts
besides these two- the original research described eight different scripts- but
hopefully these are a helpful jumping off point.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
                        <p>We also went into grocery stores to observe people
making food choices first hand.  At first our plan was to count the number of
people who stopped at different kinds of store samples, for example, for either
fruit or cheese, to see if we could learn something about how grocery store
samples work. When we started talking to the people who give out samples we
changed strategies though- we found that talking with just a few people gave us
some really nice insights into how free samples work in the grocery store.</p>
            <p>The lesson here is similar to what we learned before- asking
people who are really familiar with a subject is a great way to learn about it
quickly. And it was definitely faster than just counting the number of people
who walk by free fruit samples.</p>

					  <q>Find high-traffic locations near the front of the store or along busy paths.</q>

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>We learned that it's important to choose the right place to 
introduce people to something new.</p>
            <p>Important displays are often located in the entryway of the 
store, or along the most common path people use to find their way around the 
store. For example, in my local Whole Foods, the entryway contains a sign
advertising the whole foods app, along with the weekly sale flyer and even
some displays for foods that are on sale. Just inside the door, in the produce
section, is a display with some really good but pretty expensive guacamole.</p>
            <p>Displays often incorporate a table- it creates a place along the
path to stop. Compare this to an endcap for a sale item that doesn't have a table.</p>
            <p>One woman used a shopping cart to create a mobile display- she
could walk up to people in line at the butcher counter and get them to try a
sample while they waited. While I watched she sold a lot of cottage cheese.</p>
            <p>One woman said, "don’t bother putting the granola display next
to the granola—or even the milk. Put it along a path in the store that gets a
lot of traffic."</p>
            <p>This is relevant in the world of libraries. When we've asked people
where they learn about new things at our library, they invariably say "signage 
that was placed right by the entry control station."</p>

					  <q>This granola display was very successful before a big football game- it seemed like people were looking for an alternative to traditional game day snacks.</q>

            <p>This is the woman with the granola stand advice from our last
slide. She also had good advice on timing- she gave out samples the weekend of a
big football game and managed to sell a lot of granola. People come into the 
grocery store looking to solve an immediate problem- they need food for something.
If you offer something that solves their problem, you have a better chance of 
convincing them to try something new that if it was totally random.</p>
            <p>Again, this relates to the world of libraries. During finals week,
we've put on a coloring event for people to relax and unwind- it was very well

					<aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the reasons there are live people giving out samples is so that
they can figure out what you're looking for in a product, and then they can highlight 
those aspects of the product to you. Yogurt might be tasty, good for you, or on sale-
a live person can figure out which of those things you're looking for.</p>
            <p>Similarly, when it comes to signage and printed materials,
people see words they’re on the lookout for. If people are looking for things
without gluten, they’ll see the word "gluten" on the package. Other people
won’t know the word is there.</p>
            <p>We observed this in libraries looking at the kinds of library news

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>(John passes out "prompt" and "transforming idea" cards.)</p>
            <p>Kathy: Because we're limited for time, we wanted to give you a
jumping off point to get started.</p>
            <p>There are two different kinds of cards: "prompt cards" and 
"transforming ideas" cards. There are two different kinds of prompt cards:
prompts called "there's an app for that", where the idea starts off as an 
app, and "saucy services", where the idea starts off as a service.</p>
            <p>John: For the workshop, We're defining service design as something
where you design the patron-facing and internal workflows that make something
happen. In the commercial world, one-click buying on Amazon.com is an example
of service design. As a customer what happens is simple, but there is
complexity on the back end that you're shielded from. A "Get it" button is an
example in libraries. From the patron's perspective, they just click a button
that gets the item they want from another library. But on the back end a lot
more happens.</p>
            <p>Kathy: We provided two different kinds of prompts, because at
the early-prototyping stage a lot of things can change. You might decide you
want to make an app, or a website, or you might nudge your idea a bit and make
it an in-person service. In-person services often have digital components to
them. Don't feel restricted to just one thing.</p>
            <p>The second kind of card is a "transforming ideas" card. We included
four ways to transform ideas. First, there are "digital component" cards- your ideas
can change from a smart phone app to an app for some kind of smart object or to 
a website. They can also change from a digital thing to a thing that is non-digital.</p>
            <p>You can change the kind of service your idea provides, by making it a
game or a way for people to learn something new.</p>
            <p>You can also change what kind of values it appeals to, like the 
cost of something or the health benefits of something.</p>
            <p>Finally, you can change the audience for your idea- it can be for 
kids, or adults, or seniors.</p>
            <p>To give you an example of the idea generating process, John is oing to walk us through how he brainstormed off ouf one prompt card.</p>

            <p>Here are all the ideas I came up with. there are ideas for
in-store samples, apps or website features, and services.</p>
            <p>Try to push yourself to come up with a lot of ideas.</p>
            <p>One of the keys to this is that you're exploring ideas at a very
low resolution. If you decide you like an idea, you can "flesh it out" more later. But
for now, keep each individual idea simple so you can get a feeling for the range of 
potential solutions.</p>
            <p>These are "build to think" prototypes. For the students who were making
teapots that I showed you earlier, these are the equivalent of the early stages of the 
process. The point of this exercise is to help you think through the problem you're 
working on.</p>
          <p>Feel free to use the prompt cards or the transforming idea cards however
you'd like. If they help, great. if it's easier to come up with ideas without them, 
that's fine too.</p>

						<p>“Most of us have been socialized to believe that making things, whether sketches or models, is for creative people (not us), people with talent and hand skills (again, not us) and who understand the mysteries of color and proportion and form. This is a discouraging, art-based paradigm in which the value of the work is perceived to be in the output and it’s aesthetic properties. (new paragraph) There is a more productive and encouraging paradigm for making artifacts that focuses on discovery, rather than otucome. Let’s call it a learning- based paradigm, in which the value of building is the process of experimentation and the surfacing of meaning. ‘Build to think’ is a low-cost, high-impact method for helping teams find the conceptual center of their work.”</p>

					  <h1>Skits</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Libraries don't tend to generate physical things- instead they
make digital things and new services. Skits are another prototyping method you
can use to prototype the kinds of services that libraries offer.</p>

              <p>This image is from the BarnRaise 2015 design conference in Chicago.
This design team was assigned the task of helping a company called Janus Choice figure 
out how to communicate about its product.</p>

              <p>Janus Choice makes an app that helps hospital patients choose
a long-term care facility after they have received their discharge orders from the
hospital.</p> 

              <p>Some things to note- all props were build quickly using paper and
markers- the nurses costume, the patient's cast, and the app mockup were all drawn
using oversized post-it pads.</p>

              <p>Because you'll be telling a story, the process of making a
skit will help you find a conceptual center for your team's idea and expand on
it. For the Janus Choice skit, the team focused on how the app could reduce the
complexity of this descision process for a patient and their family. The
narrative they developed could be polished and used to communicate about Janus
Choice with patients or potential investors.</p>

            <p>There are a few different ways to do this. Drawing is one way-
you can make storyboards that call out important parts of your solution. This
is a screenshot for digital storyboarding software, but it's actually easier to
just use paper. See how there is a scene involving a car getting a flat tire
that leads to a few of an app that presumably helps drivers in trouble.</p>

            <p>If you're making a digital thing, and you include an image of
it, be sure to only include the most relevant screen or view. To me one of the
best things about storyboarding for digital things is that it makes you focus
on the context that an app will be used in, and it encourages you to only
include the most relevant screens.</p>

detail that isn't important at this stage.</p>

<p>Here's a paper prototype for a smart phone app that works with a smart tv.
This one looks like it's for a fantasy sports team.</p>

            <p>These designers used software called Protosketch that lets them
add clickable buttons to photos of their sketches. This lets them figure out
exactly what screens an app might need, without having to do a lot of design
work.</p>

            <p>This one is fancy. It's for a smart phone app. Even though this
was more work that the prototypes we just saw this is still much less work than
actually laying out the design on the computer and coding it.</p>

            <p>This image shows different interface pieces the designer could
use to mock up different screens on the app. As potential users "click" by pressing
their finger down on the paper, the designer can scroll by moving the paper, or 
change the state of buttons or other widgets by placing the little extra pieces
of paper where they'd need to go. This lets him get a sense of what the real 
interface might need.</p>

              <p>We did a class project with interface mockups for the Chicago Park District.</p>
              <p>For a little background, in Chicago, the aquarium, the natural history museum and the
planetarium are on park district property. This is the line at the aquarium-
on a weekend, even in cold weather, people will wait for hours to get inside.

              <p>Here you can see the acquarium in the background- that's the
busiest museum by far. Our goal was to make an app that would encourage
visitors to explore the rest of the Chicago Park District, not just the
museums.</p>

              <p>We went back with a prototype that people could look at on
their phones.  After getting feedback on our initial design we made revisions,
and then we went out to the park district again for another round of feedback.</p>

            <p>Here's the home screen of our prototype- we ended up making a
scavenger hunt game.</p>
            <p>We learned a lot by doing this project. I think the most important thing is 
how hard it actually is to get people to use an app in the first place. Learning about an app,
downloading it, and actually using it are a lot of hurdles to get past. For the Park District
project, prototyping like this got us to a point where we were spending as much time on the 
signage that told people about the app as we were on the app itself.</p>
<p>That experience led into this workshop. We wanted to make a workshop that is
about prototypes that explore the context around an app or service, because the
context around the thing you make is incredibly important. You have to be fully
aware of how big of a deal it is to try to get someone like a visitor to the
Chicago Park District to put a new piece of software on their phone and run
it.</p>

              <p>If you're up to the challenge, when it comes to interface
prototypes there are a lot of options for software. Sketch and InVision are two
that let you make test interfaces without doing any coding. The interfaces have
clickable buttons, and they let you swipe and move through different
screens.</p>

            <p>The project was about a redesign of the seating in buses and trains- recently the city
moved from seats that face forward to more seats that face sideways. This allows more people to fit 
onto a bus or train during rush hour.</p>

that simuluates the inside of an airplane- but this approach let them do it at a fraction of the 
cost it would have been with a real airplane.</p>

            <p>Today we did a whirlwind tour- we started by looking at research and then we came up with a "toy idea" to solve a
problem.</p>
            <p>This is a minuature of the way lots of people think about the design process. One of the simplest ways to describe
what design is, is to say that it's a two-part process- analysis and synthesis. You analyze how people act, or how existing solutions
work. You interview people, do surveys, and look at other people's websites to see how they're solving the problems you're trying
to solve.</p>

            <p>Then you come up with a few alternate solutions and find some way to decide which one to more forward with. We 
recommend finding ways to explore a few potential solutions quickly- this is why we did all of the drawing today.</p>

            <p>In between the two things- between analysis and synthesis- there's a spark of creativity. It's the moment when 
you come up with a good solution. This workshop was all about the middle place- between the hard work of analysis and synthesis.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in reading more about how designers model the creative process, we highly recommend the following
article.</p>
